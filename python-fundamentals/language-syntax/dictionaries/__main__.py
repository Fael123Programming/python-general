# Dictionaries are another unordered data structure in Python. They are a collection of couples of keys and values like
# a map in another languages. Each map must be a string and the value can be whichever data type supported by Python.
# Constraints: there cannot be put a mutable data type (like a list) as a dictionary key and also, keys that is being used
# more than once.
